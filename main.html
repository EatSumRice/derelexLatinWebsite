            <p>Derek and I are TJHSST Latin students who have attended Latin for 3 years (and plan on taking a
              fourth year).

            <p>With our term in Latin ending, we would like to help pass on Latin to others. Sadly,
              due to the belief that "Latin is very hard" and many believing that it is a dead language,
              there are less people applying for Latin. If you believe in these things, please reconsider.
              It may be tough and others may not believe it is useful in the future, but Latin provides
              a culture that is different from the other languages. First of all, if you ever utilize the
              language knowledge in your high school, I will be surprised. Second, Latin is a close knit
              community with many peers that are willing to help you learn. You won't have nearly as many
              fun events or ceremonies in other languages. And finally, among other reasons, my peers and I
              have found that as long as you don't slack off in class, you can get a good grade.

            <p>VJCL is the state convention for Virginia. If you live in a different state, there will
              be a different convention name. State conventions give a multitude of tests every year.
              Your school, if Latin is available, will likely have an option to participate in this.
            </p>
            <p>NJCL is the national version of the state convention. At the national convention
              there will be more tests, but it will be on a larger scale (more competition)
            </p>
            <p>NLE is a singular test that every school should offer. If you get a really good score in this
              test (such as maximum of 3 mistakes), you will get a medal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The NJCL Exams are similar to the national convention exams, but are different tests that
              the school offer
            </p>
            <p>
              The CAV offers a multitude of ways to prove yourself, such as poems, tests, and pieces of writings.
              Pick what you like to do and go for the medal!

              The Medusa Exam is all about mythology. We do not teach any of that, but if you are interested,
              a simple search on "mythology medusa exam" will likely do.
