            <p>We are TJHSST Latin students who have attended Latin for 3 years (and plan on taking a
              fourth year).

            <p>With our term in Latin ending, we would like to help pass on Latin to others. Sadly,
              due to the belief that "Latin is very hard" and many believing that it is a dead language,
              there are less people applying for Latin. If you believe in these things, please reconsider.
              It may be tough and others may not believe it is useful in the future, but Latin provides
              a culture that is different from the other languages. 
              First of all, Latin is actually a very useful language. While it is not spoken anymore, 
              it is still the parent of many other languages, including English.
              Latin also teaches a lot of grammar, 
              so you get to learn more about grammar and English in general.
              Second, Latin is a close knit community with many peers that are willing to help you learn. 
              You won't have nearly as many fun events or ceremonies in other languages. 
              And finally, Latin is not the hard beast that many make it out to seem. 
              It can be challenging, but if you work hard, like any other language, you can learn it!

            <p>The VJCL convention is the state convention for Virginia. If you live in a different state, there will
              be a different convention for your state. State conventions host a multitude of tests and other contests each year.
              If Latin is available at your school, you will likely have an opportunity to participate in this.
            </p>
            <p>The NJCL convention is the national version of the state convention. At the national convention
              there will be even more tests, contests, and other fun events, and it will be on a larger scale (more competition).
            </p>
            <p>The NLE is a singular test that every school should offer. 
              Depending on how well you do, you can receive medals (bronze, silver, gold)!
            </p>
            <p>
              The NJCL Exams are exams that test a variety of knowledge, such as etymology, vocabulary, and Roman life.
              There are also new test options related to the Hellenic (Greek) language and culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              The CAV offers a multitude of ways to prove yourself, such as writing essays (in both Latin and English) and taking exams.
              Pick what you like to do and go for the medal!
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>The Medusa Exam is all about mythology. We do not teach any of that, but if you are interested,
              a simple search on "mythology medusa exam" will likely do.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>There are so many other exams available, even ones for younger students not in high school. Take a look at all the exams here for more information!
