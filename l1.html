            <p>In order to succeed in Latin, it is important to have a strong foundation in English grammar. 
                This lesson will go over the three most basic parts of speech: Nouns, Adjectives, and Verbs.</p>
            
            <h4>Nouns</h4>
            <p>Nouns can be usually generalized as people, places, things, or ideas. 
                Two ways that nouns are often used are as subjects and direct objects. 
                Subjects are nouns that are doing an action, and direct objects are nouns that are being acted upon.
                <br>Examples: Julius Caesar, Rome, Toga, Happiness</p>
            
            <h4>Adjectives</h4>
            <p>Adjectives are words that describe a noun.<br>Examples: Happy, Sad, Gloomy, Smart</p>
            
            <h4>Verbs</h4>
            <p>Verbs are words that are used to describe actions.<br>Examples: Run, Sit, Read, Write</p>
