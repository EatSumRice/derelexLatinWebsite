            <p class="lesson">In order to succeed in Latin, it is important to have a strong foundation in English grammar. 
                This lesson will go over the three most basic parts of speech: Nouns, Adjectives, and Verbs. 
                <br>If you are already familiar with these constructs, then feel free to move onto lesson 2.</p>
            
            <h4 class="lesson">Nouns</h4>
            <p class="lesson">Nouns can be usually generalized as people, places, things, or ideas. 
                Two ways that nouns are often used are as subjects and direct objects. 
                Subjects are nouns that are doing an action, and direct objects are nouns that are being acted upon.
                <br>Examples: Julius Caesar, Rome, Toga, Happiness</p>
            
            <h4 class="lesson">Adjectives</h4>
            <p class="lesson">Adjectives are words that describe a noun.<br>Examples: Happy, Sad, Gloomy, Smart</p>
            
            <h4 class="lesson">Verbs</h4>
            <p class="lesson">Verbs are words that are used to describe actions.<br>Examples: Run, Sit, Read, Write</p>

In this sentence, the word that is describing the action is 'pets', so it is the verb. The noun doing the petting is the subject, and the noun being petted is the direct object, so 'Charlie' and 'dog' are the subject and direct object respectively. Finally, the adjective is 'happy', because it is describing the dog. An important note to make here is that 'the' is an article which is not translated into Latin. Instead articles (a, an, or the) are put on as needed to any nouns in Latin when translating to English."]);
